Unix like systems
-----------------

If you are building and installing uz80as from source on Unix systems, you can
find detailed instructions in the file INSTALL, included in the source
distribution of uz80as.

After installing, you can type `man uz80as' to see a brief explanation on how
to use the `uz80as' program.  More detailed documentation can be found using
the GNU documentation system: type `info uz80as' to read it.

Normally, after installing from source, you can find this on your system:

/usr/local/bin/uz80as			The program executable.
/usr/local/share/man/man1/uz80as.1	The manual page.
/usr/local/share/info/uz80as.info	The info manual.
/usr/local/share/doc/bas55/COPYING	License.
/usr/local/share/doc/bas55/README	This file.
/usr/local/share/doc/bas55/NEWS		What's new in this version.

If you are installing uz80as using your OS distribution package system, these
folders will probably be different.  Try changing /usr/local to /usr.

Cygwin
------

You can use Cygwin on Microsoft Windows to have a Unix like environment on that
operating system.  uz80as builds and installs correctly using Cygwin.

Microsoft Windows
