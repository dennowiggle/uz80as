uz80as - Micro Z80 Assembler
============================

`uz80as` is an assembler for the Zilog Z80 and other 8 bit microprocessors.
It accepts source files with the same syntax accepted by the Telemark Cross
Assembler (TASM), with only minor differences.

Currently, uz80as can assemble for these microprocessors:
  - Zilog Z80
  - Sharp LR35902 (Nintendo Gameboy CPU)

uz80as is free software. See the file `COPYING` for copying conditions.

Windows precompiled binaries
============================

A precompiled distribution for *Microsoft Windows* is provided in a ZIP file.
It can be found at http://jorgicor.sdfeu.org/uz80as . After decompressing it,
you will have these files:

~~~
uz80as.exe      The program.
uz80as.html     The manual.
readme.txt      This file.
copying.txt     License.
news.txt        What's new in this version.

Compiling
=========

Getting the code from revision control
--------------------------------------

If you cloned the project from a revision control system (i.e. GitHub), you
will need first to use the GNU autotools to generate some files, in particular,
the `configure` script. Use:

    $ ./bootstrap

to generate the required files. You will need *GNU autoconf*, *GNU automake*,
*GNU texinfo* and *help2man*.

Compiling from the source distribution
--------------------------------------

If you have the official source package, and you are building on a Unix-like
environment (this includes *Cygwin* on *Windows*), you can find detailed
instructions in the file `INSTALL`. The complete source distribution can always
be found at http://jorgicor.sdfeu.org/uz80as .  

After installing, you can type `man uz80as` to see a brief explanation on how
to use the `uz80as` program. More detailed documentation can be found using the
GNU documentation system: type `info uz80as` to read it.

Normally, after installing from source, you can find this on your system:

~~~
/usr/local/bin/uz80as                    The program executable.
/usr/local/share/man/man1/uz80as.1       The manual page.
/usr/local/share/info/uz80as.info        The info manual.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/COPYING      License.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/README       This file.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/NEWS         What's new in this version.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/INSTALL      How to compile, install and uninstall.
/usr/local/share/doc/uz80as/AUTHORS      Authors.
~~~

If you are installing uz80as using your OS distribution package system, these
folders will probably be different. Try changing `/usr/local` to `/usr`.
