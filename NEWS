1.04	2018-07-15

	* uz80as becomes a multitarget assembler. The default target is the
	  Zilog Z80. Other targets can be selected using the `--target` command
	  line option.

	* The targets accepted are:
	  - z80: Zilog Z80 (the default if no target specified).
	  - i8080: Intel 8080.
	  - gbcpu: Sharp LR35902 (Nintendo Gameboy CPU).

	* Added the `--undocumented` command line option to enable undocumented
	  instructions.

	* Added a `--license` command line option.

	* Fixed: for the Z80, the `OUT (C),0` and SLL instructions where
	  accepted by default, but they are undocumented instructions. Now are
	  only accepted with the `--undocumented` command line option.

1.03	2017-04-04

	* Fixed typo in the --help output (assemle to assemble).

	* Separating a long command line option from its argument using '=' now
	  is accepted, for example, `--define="MUL(a,b) (a*b)"`.

	* The CHANGELOG.md file is now called NEWS.

1.02	2016-09-02

	* Fixed: the object and listing files, when they were not specified
	  on the command line, were generated in the same directory of the
	  source. Now they are generated in the current working directory.
